## _devnotes remember everything so you don’t have to..._

Welcome to devnotes, where programming syntax and concepts stick around longer than your morning coffee’s warmth!.

I know how easy it is to forget a piece of syntax or lose grip on a complex concept, especially when you're juggling multiple programming languages.

One moment you're an expert coder, skillfully navigating through Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python, and the next, you find yourself puzzled, struggling to remember how to write a simple loop.

You code with confidence, crafting a complex service or application. But just a few weeks later, you find yourself puzzled, staring at the code and wondering if it was really you who wrote it. You just need a few minutes to gather yourself and get back up to speed.

That's why i've created this, to help me quickly refresh my memory with concise notes and guidelines on a wide range of programming topics. From Python's intricate functions to the delicate art of CSS, this provides easy-to-digest information that strengthens your coding skills and boosts your memory.

It's like having a cheat sheet that's always there when you need it, ensuring you spend less time relearning and more time doing what you do best—coding!

I know there are some fantastic free tools available, like Notion.so, which I already use, but I'm looking for something that better suits my style and, of course, I love coding! :)
